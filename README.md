# Spotify Most Streamed Songs 2024 Analysis

This repository contains a set of data analysis tasks performed on the "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024" dataset. The tasks involve implementing various regression and classification models to analyze the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is `spotify_data.csv`, which includes information about the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2024.

## Tasks

### 1. Simple Linear Regression (L12 - 2 points)
- **Objective:** Use a simple linear regression model to predict Spotify streams based on track score.
- **Steps:**
  1. Preprocess the data to select relevant columns and handle missing values.
  2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
  3. Train the linear regression model.
  4. Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R^2 score.
  5. Make predictions on new data.
  
### 2. Multiple Linear Regression (L12 - 2 points)
- **Objective:** Use a multiple linear regression model to predict Spotify streams based on multiple features.
- **Steps:**
  1. Preprocess the data to select relevant columns and handle missing values.
  2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
  3. Train the multiple linear regression model.
  4. Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R^2 score.
  5. Make predictions on new data.
  
### 3. Decision Tree Regression (L13 - 3 points)
- **Objective:** Use a decision tree regression model to predict Spotify streams based on track score.
- **Steps:**
  1. Preprocess the data to select relevant columns and handle missing values.
  2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
  3. Train the decision tree regression model.
  4. Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R^2 score.
  5. Make predictions on new data.
  
### 4. Logistic Regression (L14 - 3 points)
- **Objective:** Use a logistic regression model to classify whether a track is explicit based on track score and Spotify streams.
- **Steps:**
  1. Preprocess the data to select relevant columns and handle missing values.
  2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
  3. Train the logistic regression model.
  4. Evaluate the model using accuracy score.
  5. Make predictions on new data.
  
### 5. Decision Tree Classification (L13 - 4 points)
- **Objective:** Use a decision tree classification model to classify whether a track is explicit based on track score and Spotify streams.
- **Steps:**
  1. Preprocess the data to select relevant columns and handle missing values.
  2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
  3. Train the decision tree classification model.
  4. Evaluate the model using accuracy score.
  5. Make predictions on new data.
